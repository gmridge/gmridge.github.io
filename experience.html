    <h1>Relevant Experience</h1><br><br>

    <h3>VERO MARINE</h3>
   <div class="experience"><p>Nov 22 - Current<br>
        As a member of the Product & Platform team I am able to help with the process from need to build to
        implementation and upkeep.

        Being a part of the team that sits between the Software Engineers and Underwriters I got to experience a unique
        look into meeting deadlines, pitching for budget, communicating with other departments to reach company wide
        needs all while meeting my own teams targets.
    </p>

    <h3>TVNZ</h3>
    <p>Mar 22 - Nov 22<br>
        My role at TVNZ in the IT HelpDesk team was varied as I have adapted to the needs of my

        team and took on bigger projects to implement company-wide changes

        and strategies.

        I have made lasting relationships with other departments, been able to communicate effectively with management,
        display lasting organizational skills and show flexibility within my role.
